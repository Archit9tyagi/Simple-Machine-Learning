Project Title:
Height Prediction Using Simple Linear Regression

Project Description:
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of simple linear regression to predict a person’s height based on their mass using Python. The model assumes a linear relationship between mass (input feature) and height (target variable).

The following libraries were used:
	•	Pandas: For loading and handling the dataset.
	•	NumPy: For efficient numerical operations and array handling.
	•	Matplotlib: For visualizing the data and regression line.
	•	Scikit-learn (sklearn): For building, training, and evaluating the linear regression model.

Workflow Overview:
	1.	Data Preparation: Loaded the dataset containing mass and height values, and performed basic data cleaning and exploration using Pandas.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis: Used Matplotlib to visualize the relationship between mass and height.
	3.	Model Building: Employed LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model to train the model.
	4.	Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
	5.	Visualization: Plotted the regression line over the scatter plot of the data to understand how well the model fits.

This project serves as an introductory example to linear regression in machine learning and helps understand how to use popular Python libraries for data science tasks.
